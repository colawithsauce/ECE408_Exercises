# Exercises Projects in learning [ECE408](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECE408/Class+Schedule)
ECE408: Applied parallel programming is a course teaches many parallel programming concepts and its implements as well as programming, which is illustrated by CUDA. And there is also a TextBook called [Programming massively parallel processors](https://www.elsevier.com/books/programming-massively-parallel-processors/hwu/978-0-323-91231-0) for this lesson. So this project is the mass practice and labs programsthat I wrote for this lesson and this book.
